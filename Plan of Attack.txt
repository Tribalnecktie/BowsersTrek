-Test for commit


This is meant to be a sort of priority list. just with stuff we know we gotta do to make it work or thoughts and ideas.
An extra layer of communication thats not a chatroom. Please add anything you can think of as I'm sure I will miss things.
Try to give a short explanation if it may be confusing or ambiguous to others. and try to keep format for easy reading.



1.	(View) methods implemented in our (Model) classes.
	a.	Explanation: As we were trying to figure out today. 
		The purpose of the (view) class is simply to output the string. 
		In the (Model) Objects, you will need to create an instance of the (view) ConsoleView. 
		Once you have created this view in your (Model) Object class, you can use its method 
		printConsoleView(String str) to print any string you can pass it. 
		This will keep all our classes aligned with the Implementation of the MVC Architecture.
		
2.	MenuOptions Creation.
	a.	Explanation: I will be trying to do some of this as much as I can throughout the week
		and will basically be adding in the (Model) object class MenuOptions which will work
		like our other existing library classes. But this will contain the available menu options
		that will be shown to the user. Me and Katrina talked about using a hashmap<String, ArrayList<String>>
		so that we can key it out by RoomID and then store the options in the arraylist so we can access with a 
		list.length() and print each one out by list[x].
